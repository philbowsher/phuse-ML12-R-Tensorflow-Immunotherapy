<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `immunotherapy` is to demonstrate building a TensorFlow model on immunotherapy data.

This is based on the the original work by Leon Eyrich Jessen, and his blog post on RViews: ["Deep Learning for Cancer Immunotherapy"](https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2018-01-29-dl-for-cancer-immunotherapy/)

## Requirements

Packages for sequence logos and peptides

```r
devtools::install_github("omarwagih/ggseqlogo")
devtools::install_github("leonjessen/PepTools")
```
